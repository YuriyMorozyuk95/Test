Benefits of messaging with Alphanumeric Sender ID\nHigher message deliverability: In many countries, regulatory bodies are increasingly filtering illegitimate A2P SMS use cases to curb unwanted messaging. For every Alphanumeric Sender ID request, Twilio completes a rigorous due-diligence and registration process with the telecommunication carrier in that country. Once this process is completed, Twilio handles fluctuating telecom logic, regulations, and carrier-specific rules to ensure your A2P messages reach their destination.\n  \nImproved brand recognition: Because recipients see your name with every SMS sent, using a recognizable Alphanumeric Sender ID reinforces your branding.\n  \nIncreased open rates: As cases of spam and fraud increase, being able to easily identify the sender is a key factor in whether recipients decide whether to open a message. If the sender is an international or unfamiliar number, the chance of the message being opened is next to none. With Alphanumeric Sender IDs, recipients immediately recognize the sender and know the message is legitimate. As a result, they are up to 80% more likely to open the message.\n \nAlternative to 10DLC A2P messaging: \n\nAlphanumeric Sender IDs can help work around the common challenges to A2P messaging as a high throughput and low carrier filtering option.
